# GL_2d_engine
Our attempt at a 2d game engine in C++, using opengl for graphics and GLFW for windowing.

This project will hopefully grow into a multi-purpose utility for making indie games with high performance and minimal technincal overhead.

The code can very easily be extended into 3D. As we progress, we will consider forking the project into a 3d version.
